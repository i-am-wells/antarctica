Game: what to do with items?
  make things/build things
  - unlock inventions/technologies/processes
  - need to develop resources/manpower to implement
  - example: mine, transportation, refinery/forge, factories
  -- supported by big workforce: need housing, food, education?

UI/game: should have a stack of "contexts"

game context -> menu context -> another menu context
(draw those in reverse order; have later controls supersede earlier)

Recap of how control works:
  controlMap: keyboard -> name of an action
  onkeydown/up: name of action -> handler
